<AiVideo id="vybecoding-101-course-intro" script={`Hi! Welcome to VybeCoding 101 with v0.

In this short course you'll learn how to turn ideas into interactive experiences with almost no boilerplate.

We’ll cover the flow of a VybeCoding session, get you set up, and build your first mini app.

Scroll down and let’s start vibing with code!`} />

VybeCoding 101 is a compact, hands-on introduction to building interactive experiences with **v0** in just about 2 hours. The focus is on exploration, creativity, and fast feedback rather than heavy theory.

## Who this course is for

This course is designed for:

* Students who want to **experience coding as play** rather than as a rigid task
* Beginners with **little or no programming background**
* Makers, designers, and tinkerers curious about **rapid prototyping** with v0
* Instructors who want a **structured 2 hour VybeCoding session** outline

You do **not** need to:

* Know a specific programming language in depth
* Be comfortable with terminals or complex tools

It helps if you:

* Are comfortable using a browser
* Can follow step-by-step instructions
* Are open to experimenting and making mistakes in front of others 😊

## What you will learn

By the end of this 2 hour lecture + guided lab, you should be able to:

* Explain what **VybeCoding** is and how it differs from traditional coding practice
* Understand the **core flow** of a VybeCoding session using v0
* Set up your **v0 environment** and onboarding basics
* Run through a **guided VybeCoding exercise** from idea → prototype → share
* Reflect on how VybeCoding can be used in **future learning or projects**

## Course structure

The course is intentionally small and focused so it fits into one 2 hour block.

### Module 1: Getting started with VybeCoding

1. **Course flow and goals** (`~20 min`)
   * What VybeCoding is
   * Why we’re using v0
   * What we’ll build together
   * How the 2 hour session is structured
2. **Setup and onboarding** (`~20–25 min`)
   * Accessing v0
   * Basic navigation
   * Core concepts you’ll touch (components, prompts, iterations)
3. **First VybeCoding session** (`~60–70 min`)
   * Warm-up mini prompts
   * Main guided build (simple interactive app)
   * Share, reflect, and next steps

## How to use this course in a 2 hour lecture

A suggested timeline for instructors:

1. **0–10 min – Welcome & framing**
   * Introduce VybeCoding mindset
   * Explain expectations and outcomes
2. **10–30 min – Course flow & setup**
   * Walk through Module 1.1 and 1.2
   * Ensure all students can access v0
3. **30–90 min – First VybeCoding session**
   * Follow Module 1.3
   * Alternate between live demo and hands-on student time
4. **90–120 min – Sharing & reflection**
   * Students briefly present what they built
   * Group discussion
   * Connect to future learning opportunities

## Prerequisites and materials

To run this course smoothly, make sure you have:

* **Stable internet connection** for everyone
* **Modern browser** (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox recommended)
* Access to **v0** (accounts created or invited ahead of time, if required)
* Projector or shared screen for instructor demos

Optional but helpful:

* Headphones (if students prefer focus)
* A note-taking method (digital or paper) to capture ideas and prompts

## Teaching tips for instructors

* Emphasize **experimentation over perfection**
* Keep your demo **slightly ahead** of the class, but pause frequently
* Encourage students to **show unfinished work**
* Normalize errors and glitches as part of the vibe
* Use **short time-boxed challenges** to keep energy high

At this level, the goal is **confidence and curiosity**, not mastery.
