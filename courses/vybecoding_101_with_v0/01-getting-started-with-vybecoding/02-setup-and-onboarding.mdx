title: "Setup and onboarding"
description: "Get everyone into v0, understand the interface, and prepare for the first VybeCoding session."
---

This chapter is about **removing friction**: making sure every student can access **v0**, understands the **essential interface areas**, and knows how to start a simple project.

> In a live 2 hour session, aim to keep this to **20–25 minutes** so most time goes into hands-on building.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Access v0 and sign in or accept an invite
- Identify the **main areas of the v0 interface** you’ll use today
- Create a **new workspace or project** suitable for VybeCoding
- Run a **first simple prompt** and see a result you can edit

## Step 1: Accessing v0

The exact steps may differ depending on how your school or team uses v0, but the flow is usually:

1. Open your browser and go to the **v0 URL** provided by your instructor.
2. Sign in with either:
   - A school account, or
   - An email and password, or
   - A single sign-on provider (Google, GitHub, etc.).
3. If you received an **invite link**:
   - Click the link
   - Accept the invitation to the **class workspace** or organization

Instructors: if possible, do this **ahead of class** for yourself so you can troubleshoot common issues.

## Step 2: Key parts of the v0 interface

We’ll only use a **minimal subset** of v0 to keep things beginner-friendly. Typical key areas:

- **Projects or Workspaces list**: where you see existing projects and can create new ones
- **Canvas / Editor area**: where the main layout or code appears
- **Prompt or command area**: where you describe changes you want v0 to make
- **Preview / Run area**: where you see and interact with the result

You do **not** need to understand every button today. Focus on:

- How to **open a project**
- Where you **see the app**
- Where you **talk to v0** (prompt/command box)

## Step 3: Creating your first project for VybeCoding

Instructors should decide the exact project template ahead of time. A simple pattern:

1. Click **New Project** (or similar button).
2. Choose a **basic template** (e.g., “Empty app”, “Minimal UI”).
3. Name it something like **“VybeCoding 101 – YourName”**.
4. Confirm it opens in the editor view.

For a smoother class, you can also:

- Pre-create a **starter project** and have students **duplicate it**.
- Include a few **example components** or text on the screen to reduce “blank page” anxiety.

## Step 4: Running a first tiny prompt

To show what VybeCoding feels like, run **one very small change** via v0.

Example prompt ideas for the instructor demo:

- “Add a big centered title that says ‘Welcome to VybeCoding 101’.”
- “Change the background to a soft gradient that feels calm and friendly.”
- “Create a button labeled ‘Change the vibe’ under the title.”

After running the prompt:

- Point out **what changed** in the editor
- Show where the **generated structure or code** appears
- Click into the preview to **interact** (even if the button does nothing yet)

## Step 5: Students do it themselves

Give students 5–10 minutes to:

1. Create or open their own project for this session.
2. Run **at least two prompts**, for example:
   - Change the main text to something personal.
   - Adjust colors or layout to fit a mood.
3. Optionally, tweak one or two small details **manually** (like editing a label).

Encourage:

- Sharing screens with neighbors if stuck
- Asking “how do I do X?” out loud
- Celebrating **small visible changes**

## Common setup pitfalls and how to handle them

In a classroom, expect a few issues:

- **Login problems**: have a backup account or guest access plan.
- **Browser incompatibility**: suggest switching to Chrome/Edge.
- **Slow connection**: pair students so at least one device in each pair works smoothly.
- **Overwhelm from options**: verbally limit scope: “For now, ignore everything except the canvas, preview, and prompt box.”

As an instructor, it helps to assign **one helper** (teaching assistant or an early finisher) to roam and support peers.

## Ready to VybeCode

Once everyone has:

- Access to v0
- A project open
- Successfully run **at least one prompt**

…you’re ready to move into the **first full VybeCoding session**, where we’ll work from a small creative brief and build together.
