  script={`Welcome to your first full VybeCoding session!

In this chapter we’ll turn a tiny creative brief into a working prototype using v0.

You’ll warm up with small prompts, then build, iterate, and finally share what you made.

Let’s dive straight into the vibes and start creating.`} />

This is the **hands-on heart** of the course. You’ll move from a small idea to a working, shareable prototype using v0, all within about an hour.

> Instructors: treat this chapter as a **step-by-step script** for the live 60–70 minute session.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Follow a **VybeCoding session flow** from brief → build → iterate → share
- Use v0 prompts to create and adjust a small interactive experience
- Talk about your prototype in terms of **vibe, behavior, and choices**

## Session outline

A suggested breakdown for ~60–70 minutes:

1. **Warm-up micro prompts** (10–15 min)
2. **Introduce the main brief** (5 min)
3. **Guided first build pass** (15–20 min)
4. **Iteration rounds** (15–20 min)
5. **Sharing and reflection** (10–15 min)

Adjust timings to match your group’s pace.

## 1. Warm-up micro prompts (10–15 min)

Goal: get everyone **comfortable typing prompts** into v0 and observing changes.

Instructor demo ideas (students mirror you):

1. Change the title text to something playful.
2. Ask v0 to adjust colors to match a specific vibe (e.g., “chill evening”, “energetic morning”).
3. Add a button and some text that reacts when the button is clicked (even with a simple message).

Example prompt sequence:

- “Update the main heading to say ‘Today’s vibe’.”
- “Change the background to a soft gradient that feels like a calm morning.”
- “Add a large button below the heading that says ‘Surprise me’ and show a little message under it when clicked.”

Encourage students to **personalize** at least one element (their name, favorite color, a phrase they like).

## 2. Introduce the main brief (5 min)

Pick one clear, simple brief and stick to it. Example:

> **Brief:** Build a tiny **mood check-in app**. The user chooses or clicks a mood, and the app responds with a message or small change in the interface that matches that mood.

Explain:

- The scope is intentionally small.
- The goal is to **explore** different ideas, not to ship a perfect product.
- Any of these are valid:
  - A few buttons for different moods
  - A dropdown and a response
  - A slider with a changing description

Students can vary the theme: moods, energy levels, focus levels, etc.

## 3. Guided first build pass (15–20 min)

Walk the class through **one full pass** from blank-ish screen to a basic mood check-in.

Suggested steps (instructor-led, students follow):

1. **Structure**
   - Prompt: “Create a simple layout with a title at the top, a short description, and three big buttons labeled ‘Happy’, ‘Tired’, and ‘Stressed’.”

2. **Behavior**
   - Prompt: “When each button is clicked, show a message under the buttons that responds to that mood in a friendly, encouraging way.”

3. **Styling**
   - Prompt: “Style the buttons so each mood has a distinct color, and make the messages easy to read.”

4. **Fine-tune**
   - Manually tweak one or two labels or messages to feel more personal.

After this pass, everyone should have **a basic working app**.

## 4. Iteration rounds (15–20 min)

Now shift from following to **exploring**.

Run 2–3 short, time-boxed rounds (5–7 minutes each):

### Round 1: Personalize the vibe

Prompt ideas:

- “Adjust the colors and fonts so the app feels like a cozy evening journal.”
- “Make the layout more compact so it fits nicely on a mobile-sized screen.”

Encourage students to:

- Change mood labels to ones they actually use
- Rewrite messages in their own voice

### Round 2: Add a little magic

Prompt ideas:

- “Add a simple animation or effect when a mood is selected.”
- “Show a small suggestion under the message, like ‘Take a 1 minute break’ or ‘Write one thing you’re grateful for’.”

Students can propose their own variations, and you can pick a few to try live.

### Optional Round 3: Stretch goals

If time and skill allow:

- Add a **reset** button
- Track **how many times** a user has checked in
- Show a **timestamp** of the last mood selection

Remind everyone: it’s okay if not everything works perfectly. The focus is **trying and observing**.

## 5. Sharing and reflection (10–15 min)

Reserve time at the end for **quick demos**.

### Fast demo format

Ask for volunteers to share, each for 1–2 minutes:

- Show the app
- Click through a couple of moods
- Say one thing they changed that reflects their personal style

Celebrate variety: colors, wording, structure, even glitches.

### Reflection prompts

Discuss as a group (or have students jot notes):

- What felt **surprisingly easy** with v0?
- What was **frustrating or confusing**?
- How did using prompts change how you think about coding?
- Where could you imagine using VybeCoding again (projects, other classes, hobbies)?

## Adapting difficulty

For **absolute beginners**:

- Keep everything prompt-based
- Avoid opening raw code unless necessary
- Focus language on “screens”, “buttons”, and “messages” rather than technical terms

For **more experienced students**:

- Show how to lightly edit the generated code or structure
- Invite them to add one small custom behavior by hand

## Wrapping up the session

End by clearly marking the finish:

- Congratulate everyone on building and sharing something
- Remind them that imperfect prototypes are **normal and valuable**
- Suggest a simple follow-up: “Later this week, spend 15 minutes making a new variation of your app or starting a fresh idea.”
