  script={`Hey! In this chapter we’ll set the stage for VybeCoding 101.

You’ll learn what VybeCoding means, how v0 supports it, and what we’ll do in the next 2 hours.

By the end, you should know exactly what to expect and how to engage.

Let’s map out the flow together!`} />

This chapter gives you a **high-level map** of the VybeCoding 101 session: what VybeCoding is, what we aim to achieve, and how the 2 hours are structured.

## What is VybeCoding?

**VybeCoding** is an approach to coding that emphasizes:

- **Playfulness** over strict correctness
- **Fast feedback** over heavy planning
- **Expressiveness** over low-level boilerplate

Instead of focusing on syntax and rigid rules, VybeCoding asks:

> *“What do you want this thing to feel like and do right now?”*

You then use tools like **v0** to quickly **prototype** that feeling or interaction, adjusting as you go.

### VybeCoding vs traditional coding practice

Traditional beginner coding sessions often focus on:

- Memorizing syntax
- Writing everything from scratch
- Solving abstract problems with right/wrong answers

VybeCoding sessions focus on:

- Using **high-level tools** to build something visible quickly
- Iterating based on **vibe, feedback, and curiosity**
- Producing a **shareable artifact** (even if rough) by the end

This doesn’t replace deeper learning; it **kickstarts motivation** and builds confidence.

## Why v0 for VybeCoding?

We use **v0** because it:

- Reduces friction for **getting something on screen fast**
- Lets you express intent with **natural language prompts**
- Encourages **iteration** instead of one-shot perfection

In this course, v0 acts like your **creative coding partner**:

- You describe what you want
- v0 proposes a structure or interface
- You tweak, refine, and play

You still think like a developer (flows, states, interactions), but the tool handles much of the low-level work.

## Session goals

By the end of this 2 hour VybeCoding 101 session, you should be able to:

- Explain in your own words what **VybeCoding** is
- Describe how **v0** helps you explore ideas quickly
- Run through a **simple creative brief** and turn it into an interactive prototype
- Reflect on how you might use VybeCoding in **future projects or classes**

The primary outcome: **you’ve built and shared a small interactive experience**—not perfect, but yours.

## The 2 hour flow at a glance

Here’s a suggested flow that you can adapt.

### 0–10 min: Welcome and framing

- Quick intro to VybeCoding and v0
- Set expectations: playful, experimental, okay to fail
- Show a **very small demo** of what v0 can produce in minutes

### 10–30 min: Flow and setup overview

- Walk through this chapter’s concepts
- Explain how the rest of the session will run
- Transition into setup (next chapter)

### 30–90 min: First VybeCoding session

- Warm-up: tiny prompt like “Create a playful counter that reacts when it hits 5”
- Main build: small interactive app (e.g., mini mood tracker, idea generator, simple game UI)
- Short iterations based on ideas from the room

### 90–120 min: Share and reflect

- Students demo their current state (even if incomplete)
- Group reflection:
  - What felt fun or surprising?
  - What felt confusing?
  - How could this approach support future learning?

## Engagement guidelines for students

To get the most from VybeCoding 101:

- **Stay curious**: ask “what if we tried…?” often
- **Share rough work**: don’t wait for perfection to show others
- **Embrace constraints**: time limits help you focus
- **Reflect out loud**: explain your choices even if the result is messy

Instructors should model this by talking through their own thinking and mistakes.

## Suggested mini project themes

To keep the session concrete, pick one of these themes (or invent your own):

- **Mood board app**: click to pick a vibe, see colors/phrases/images adjust
- **Idea generator**: press a button to get a random creative challenge
- **Check-in widget**: a small interaction to ask “How are you feeling?” and respond

All of these are small enough for beginners but open-ended enough for creativity.
