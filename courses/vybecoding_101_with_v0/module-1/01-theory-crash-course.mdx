# Theory crash course: v0 + Vercel basics

Before we start building, let's make sure everyone has a mental model of the tools we're using and what we're creating. This chapter covers **landing page anatomy**, **v0**, and **Vercel** — just enough to get you building confidently.

> Instructors: aim for **~40 minutes** on this section. Keep it practical and visual.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Identify the **key sections** of a landing page
- Explain what **v0** is and how it helps you build websites
- Describe v0's **strengths and limitations**
- Understand the basic **Vercel deployment model**
- Know what "done" looks like for your landing page

## What is a landing page?

A **landing page** is a single webpage designed to:

- **Grab attention** with a strong headline and visual
- **Explain** what you're offering
- **Build trust** with social proof (testimonials, logos, etc.)
- **Convert** visitors with a clear call-to-action (CTA)

Landing pages are everywhere: product launches, events, newsletters, apps. They're one of the most useful things you can learn to build.

## Anatomy of a landing page

Here are the **typical sections** you'll find on most landing pages:

### 1. Hero section

The first thing visitors see. Usually includes:

- A **headline** that hooks the reader
- A **subheadline** with more detail
- A **CTA button** (e.g., "Sign up", "Learn more")
- Often a **hero image** or illustration

### 2. Features or benefits

Explain what you're offering. Could be:

- A list of features with icons
- Benefit statements ("Save time", "Look amazing")
- For our retreat: the **agenda or schedule**

### 3. Social proof

Build trust with:

- **Testimonials** from customers or users
- Logos of companies or publications
- Stats or numbers ("10,000+ happy campers")

### 4. FAQ

Answer common questions before visitors have to ask. Reduces friction and builds confidence.

### 5. Footer

Wrap it up with:

- A **final CTA** (repeat the main action)
- Links to other pages (about, contact, terms)
- Social media links
- Copyright info

## Our project: "Definitely-Not-A-Cult Retreat"

For this course, we're building a **fake wellness retreat** landing page. The humor keeps things fun and removes the pressure to be "serious."

Your landing page will have:

- **Hero**: "Find Your Inner Peace (We Promise It's Not a Cult)"
- **Agenda**: Schedule of retreat activities
- **Testimonials**: Quotes from "satisfied guests"
- **FAQ**: Answering the hard questions ("Is this a cult?")
- **Footer**: CTA and contact info

Feel free to get creative with the copy! 🧘‍♂️

## What is v0?

**v0** is an AI-powered tool that generates UI code from natural language prompts. You describe what you want, and v0 creates it.

Think of v0 as a **creative coding partner**:

1. You describe what you want in plain English
2. v0 generates a working UI
3. You refine and iterate with more prompts
4. You get production-ready code

### v0 strengths

- **Speed**: Go from idea to working UI in minutes
- **No code required**: Describe in natural language
- **Iteration-friendly**: Easy to refine and adjust
- **Good defaults**: Clean, modern styling out of the box
- **Real code output**: You can export and deploy what you build

### v0 limitations

- **Not a designer**: It follows your prompts literally, so vague prompts = vague results
- **Needs iteration**: First drafts are rarely perfect
- **Limited context**: It doesn't remember previous projects (only the current session)
- **Best for UI**: Great for layouts and components, less suited for complex logic

### The v0 workflow

The basic loop you'll follow:

```
1. Describe → Write a prompt describing what you want
2. Generate → v0 creates a draft
3. Review → Look at what it made
4. Refine → Prompt again with adjustments
5. Repeat → Until you're happy
```

Good prompts are **specific**. Instead of "make it look better," try "use a dark background with white text and add more padding around the headline."

## Components, assets, and styling

A few concepts to know before building:

### Components

In v0, your page is made of **components** — reusable building blocks like:

- Buttons
- Cards
- Navigation bars
- Sections

You don't need to understand how components work under the hood. Just know that v0 creates them for you.

### Assets

**Assets** are images, icons, and other media on your page. For this course:

- v0 can use placeholder images
- You can describe what images you want ("a photo of people meditating in a forest")
- Later, you can swap placeholders for real images

### Styling

v0 handles styling automatically, but you can guide it:

- Mention colors ("use a purple and gold color scheme")
- Mention fonts ("use a clean sans-serif font")
- Mention spacing ("add more whitespace between sections")

## What is Vercel?

**Vercel** is a platform for deploying websites. It takes your code and puts it on the internet.

### Why Vercel?

- **Free tier**: Perfect for student projects
- **Fast**: Your site loads quickly anywhere in the world
- **Simple**: Deploy with a few clicks (no server setup)
- **Integrated with v0**: Easy to go from v0 → live site

### The Vercel deployment model

Here's how it works:

```
1. You build something in v0
2. You export or connect your project to Vercel
3. Vercel builds your site
4. Vercel hosts it at a URL (like your-project.vercel.app)
5. Anyone with the link can see your live site
```

You'll do this in Chapter 3. For now, just know: **Vercel makes your site live**.

## The "done" checklist

Before you deploy, your landing page should have:

- [ ] **Hero section** with headline, subheadline, and CTA
- [ ] **Agenda/features** section with at least 3 items
- [ ] **Testimonials** section with at least 2 quotes
- [ ] **FAQ** section with at least 3 questions
- [ ] **Footer** with a final CTA
- [ ] **Consistent styling** (colors, fonts, spacing)
- [ ] **Mobile-friendly** layout (looks good on phones)
- [ ] **No broken elements** (everything visible and aligned)

Use this checklist throughout the build process!

## Recap

Before we start building, you now understand:

- What a **landing page** is and its key sections
- How **v0** works as your AI coding partner
- The **strengths and limitations** of v0
- How **Vercel** deploys your site to the internet
- What "**done**" looks like for this project

Next up: we build the "Definitely-Not-A-Cult Retreat" landing page! 🚀
