# Build: generate + edit the landing page in v0

Time to build! In this chapter, you'll create your **"Definitely-Not-A-Cult Retreat"** landing page from scratch using v0. We'll go section by section, iterating until it looks great.

> Instructors: aim for **~55 minutes** on this section. Alternate between demos and hands-on time.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Set a clear **brief** for what you're building
- **Generate a first draft** of a landing page with v0
- Use the **prompting loop** to iterate and improve
- Edit each **section** of your landing page
- Ensure **style consistency** across the page
- Make your page **mobile-friendly** with basic accessibility

## Step 1: Set the brief (~5 min)

Before prompting, get clear on what you're building. Here's our brief:

> **Project**: "Definitely-Not-A-Cult Retreat" landing page
>
> **Vibe**: Playful, slightly mysterious, definitely not suspicious
>
> **Sections**: Hero, Agenda, Testimonials, FAQ, Footer
>
> **Target audience**: Stressed professionals looking for "enlightenment"
>
> **Tone**: Funny, welcoming, with a wink 😉

Feel free to add your own twist! The theme is flexible — make it yours.

## Step 2: Generate your first draft (~10 min)

Let's create the initial landing page with one comprehensive prompt.

### Opening v0

1. Go to [v0.dev](https://v0.dev) in your browser
2. Sign in with your account
3. Start a new project

### Your first prompt

Try something like:

> Create a landing page for "Definitely-Not-A-Cult Retreat" — a playful, fake wellness retreat. Include:
> - A hero section with the headline "Find Your Inner Peace (We Promise It's Not a Cult)" and a CTA button
> - An agenda section with 4-5 retreat activities (meditation, group chanting, etc.)
> - A testimonials section with 3 funny quotes from "past guests"
> - A FAQ section answering "Is this a cult?" and 2-3 other questions
> - A footer with a final CTA and fake contact info
>
> Use a calming color palette with subtle mysterious vibes. Make it look modern and clean.

Hit enter and watch v0 work! ✨

### Review the first draft

Look at what v0 created:

- Does it have all the sections you asked for?
- Is the overall structure right?
- Don't worry about details yet — we'll refine section by section

## Step 3: The prompting loop (~5 min)

Here's the core workflow you'll use for the rest of the build:

```
Describe → Generate → Review → Refine → Repeat
```

### Tips for better prompts

**Be specific**, not vague:

- ❌ "Make it look better"
- ✅ "Increase the font size of the headline and add more padding below it"

**Reference what exists**:

- ❌ "Change the colors"
- ✅ "Change the hero background to a dark purple gradient"

**One thing at a time** (when refining):

- ❌ "Fix the hero, testimonials, and footer"
- ✅ "Make the hero headline bigger and center it vertically"

**Describe the outcome**, not the code:

- ❌ "Add a div with padding"
- ✅ "Add more space around the testimonial cards"

## Step 4: Edit the hero section (~10 min)

The hero is the most important section. Let's polish it.

### What makes a good hero?

- **Clear headline**: Instantly tells visitors what this is
- **Subheadline**: Adds context or a hook
- **Strong CTA**: A button that invites action
- **Visual appeal**: Good contrast, readable text

### Prompts to try

Adjust the headline:

> Make the hero headline larger and add a subheadline that says "3 days of meditation, mindfulness, and definitely normal activities."

Improve the CTA:

> Change the CTA button to say "Reserve Your Spot" and make it stand out more with a contrasting color.

Add atmosphere:

> Add a subtle background image to the hero — something like a misty forest or peaceful mountains. Keep the text readable.

## Step 5: Edit the agenda section (~8 min)

The agenda shows what the retreat offers.

### What makes a good agenda?

- **Clear items**: Each activity should be easy to scan
- **Icons or visuals**: Help break up text
- **Consistent formatting**: Same style for each item

### Prompts to try

Add variety:

> Update the agenda to include these activities: Morning Meditation, Sound Bath Experience, Group Sharing Circle, Silent Lunch, Evening Reflection. Add a time for each.

Improve layout:

> Display the agenda as a timeline or schedule format instead of a simple list. Add icons for each activity.

Add humor:

> Make the activity descriptions slightly mysterious and funny, like "Group Sharing Circle — sharing is optional, eye contact is mandatory."

## Step 6: Edit the testimonials section (~8 min)

Testimonials build trust (or in our case, add humor).

### What makes good testimonials?

- **Quotes**: Real-sounding (or hilariously fake) statements
- **Attribution**: Name and maybe a title or photo
- **Layout**: Cards or a carousel work well

### Prompts to try

Make them funnier:

> Rewrite the testimonials to be subtly absurd. Example: "I came for the yoga, stayed for the unexplained sense of belonging. — Sarah M., Definitely Not Brainwashed"

Improve the design:

> Display testimonials as cards with a photo placeholder, quote, and name. Add subtle shadows for depth.

Add variety:

> Add a 4th testimonial from someone who "definitely chose to stay an extra week of their own free will."

## Step 7: Edit the FAQ section (~8 min)

FAQs address concerns before visitors ask.

### What makes a good FAQ?

- **Real questions**: What would someone actually wonder?
- **Clear answers**: Short and helpful
- **Good formatting**: Expandable accordion or clear sections

### Prompts to try

Add key questions:

> Include these FAQ questions:
> - "Is this a cult?"
> - "What should I bring?"
> - "Can I leave whenever I want?"
> - "Why do all the staff wear matching robes?"
>
> Make the answers reassuring but slightly suspicious.

Improve the format:

> Make the FAQ an accordion where each question expands to show the answer.

## Step 8: Edit the footer (~5 min)

The footer wraps things up with a final push.

### What makes a good footer?

- **Final CTA**: One more chance to convert
- **Contact info**: Even if fake
- **Links**: Social, terms, etc.
- **Clean design**: Don't overcrowd

### Prompts to try

Add a final CTA:

> Add a section above the footer with a headline like "Ready to Find Your Inner Peace?" and a large CTA button.

Complete the footer:

> Add a simple footer with fake contact info (email, phone), social media icons, and a copyright line that says "© 2024 Definitely-Not-A-Cult Retreat. All rights reserved. All members accounted for."

## Step 9: Style consistency (~5 min)

Now step back and look at the whole page. Does it feel cohesive?

### Prompts to try

Unify colors:

> Make sure all sections use the same color palette: [describe your colors]. Update any sections that look inconsistent.

Unify fonts:

> Use the same font family throughout the page. Headlines should be bold, body text should be regular weight.

Unify spacing:

> Add consistent spacing between all sections. Each section should have the same padding above and below.


### Prompts to try

Check mobile layout:

> Make sure the layout looks good on mobile devices. Stack elements vertically and ensure text is readable on small screens.

Test specific sections:

> On mobile, make the hero headline smaller and ensure the CTA button is full-width.


## Review your landing page

Before moving to deployment, check:

- **Hero**: Headline, subheadline, CTA 
- **Agenda**: 4-5 activities with descriptions 
- **Testimonials**: 3-4 quotes with attribution 
- **FAQ**: 3-4 questions with answers 
- **Footer**: Final CTA, contact info 
- **Consistent style**: Colors, fonts, spacing 
- **Mobile-friendly**: Looks good on small screens 

If something's missing, iterate! Use the prompting loop until you're happy.
