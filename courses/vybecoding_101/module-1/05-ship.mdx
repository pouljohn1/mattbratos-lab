# Ship: deploy to Vercel + post on HackLab

Your landing page is built — now let's put it on the internet and share it with the world. This chapter covers deploying to **Vercel** and posting your project on **HackLab**.

> Instructors: aim for **~25 minutes** on this section. Keep energy high — this is the finish line!

## Learning objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Run **pre-deploy checks** on your landing page
- **Deploy** your site to Vercel
- **Verify** your live site works correctly
- **Post** your project on HackLab with all required info

## Step 1: Pre-deploy checks (~5 min)

Before deploying, do a final review. You don't want to ship something broken!

### The checklist

Go through this quickly:

- [ ] **All sections visible**: Hero, agenda, testimonials, FAQ, footer
- [ ] **No placeholder text**: Remove any "Lorem ipsum" or "[Your text here]"
- [ ] **Links work**: CTA buttons should have proper actions (or placeholder "#")
- [ ] **Images load**: No broken image icons
- [ ] **Mobile looks good**: Check the mobile preview one more time
- [ ] **No obvious typos**: Quick scan of headlines and buttons

### Common issues to fix

**Broken images**:

> Replace any broken images with placeholder images that work.

**Placeholder text**:

> Remove all placeholder text like "Lorem ipsum" and replace with actual content.

**Inconsistent spacing**:

> Fix any sections that have different spacing than the rest.

Take 2-3 minutes to fix anything that stands out. Don't aim for perfect — aim for **ready**.

## Step 2: Deploy to Vercel (~8 min)

Now the exciting part: making your site live!

### Option A: Deploy directly from v0

v0 has built-in Vercel integration:

1. In v0, look for the **Deploy** or **Publish** button
2. Click it and select **Vercel** as the destination
3. Sign in to Vercel if prompted
4. Choose a project name (this becomes part of your URL)
5. Click **Deploy**

Wait for the build to complete (usually 30-60 seconds).

### Option B: Manual deploy

If direct deploy isn't available:

1. **Export your code** from v0
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
3. Click **New Project**
4. **Import** your code (drag and drop or connect a repository)
5. Click **Deploy**

### Your live URL

Once deployed, Vercel gives you a URL like:

```
https://your-project-name.vercel.app
```

This is your **live website**! Anyone with this link can see your creation.

### Custom domains (optional)

For this course, the `.vercel.app` URL is perfect. Later, you can connect a custom domain if you want.

## Step 3: Live sanity checks (~5 min)

Open your live URL in a new browser tab and verify everything works.

### Desktop check

- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] All sections appear correctly
- [ ] Images display properly
- [ ] CTA buttons are visible and styled
- [ ] Scroll through the entire page

### Mobile check

- [ ] Open the link on your phone (or use browser dev tools)
- [ ] All sections stack properly
- [ ] Text is readable
- [ ] Buttons are tappable
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling

### Share with a neighbor

If you're in a classroom:

1. Share your URL with someone next to you
2. Have them open it on their device
3. Get quick feedback: "Does anything look broken?"

### Quick fixes

If something's wrong:

1. Go back to v0
2. Fix the issue with a prompt
3. Re-deploy (usually just click Deploy again)
4. Refresh your live site

## Step 4: Post on HackLab (~7 min)

Time to show off your work! HackLab is where you share projects with your peers.

### Prepare your post

Before going to HackLab, gather:

1. **Your live URL**: Copy the Vercel link
2. **Screenshots**: Take 2-3 screenshots of your landing page
   - Full hero section
   - One other section (testimonials or FAQ)
   - Mobile view (optional but nice)
3. **A title**: Something catchy like "Definitely-Not-A-Cult Retreat 🧘‍♂️"
4. **A description**: 2-3 sentences about what you built

### Creating your HackLab post

Go to HackLab and create a new project post:

#### Title

Keep it fun and descriptive:

- "Definitely-Not-A-Cult Retreat Landing Page"
- "My First v0 Landing Page: Not a Cult, We Promise"
- "[Your Name]'s Wellness Retreat Site"

#### Description

Write 2-3 sentences:

> A landing page for a fictional wellness retreat built with v0. Features a hero section, agenda, testimonials, and FAQ. Deployed on Vercel. (This was my first time using v0!)

#### Tools used

List the tools:

- v0
- Vercel

#### Link

Paste your Vercel URL:

```
https://your-project-name.vercel.app
```

#### Screenshots

Upload 2-3 screenshots:

1. **Hero screenshot**: Shows the main headline and CTA
2. **Full page or key section**: Testimonials or agenda
3. **Mobile view** (optional): Shows responsiveness

### Tips for good screenshots

- Use your browser's **full-page screenshot** feature if available
- Crop out browser chrome (address bar, bookmarks) for cleaner images
- On Mac: `Cmd + Shift + 4` then drag to select
- On Windows: `Win + Shift + S` for snip tool

#### What you learned

Add a brief reflection:

> I learned how to use v0 to generate UI from prompts, how to iterate on designs, and how to deploy a site to Vercel. The prompting loop was really useful!

### Submit your post

Review everything and hit **Post** or **Submit**!

## Celebrate! 🎉

You did it! In under 2 hours, you:

- Learned about landing page anatomy
- Understood how v0 and Vercel work
- Built a complete landing page from scratch
- Deployed it to the live internet
- Shared it with your community

**Your website is live**. You can share the link with friends, add it to your portfolio, or use it as a starting point for future projects.

## What's next?

Now that you know the basics, you can:

- **Build another landing page** for a real project
- **Experiment with v0** for other UI types (dashboards, apps, portfolios)
- **Learn more about Vercel** for custom domains and advanced features
- **Help a classmate** who's stuck — teaching reinforces learning!

## Quick reference

### Key URLs

- **v0**: [v0.dev](https://v0.dev)
- **Vercel**: [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- **Your live site**: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

### The full workflow

```
1. Theory  → Understand the tools and goal
2. Build   → Generate and refine in v0
3. Check   → Pre-deploy verification
4. Deploy  → Push to Vercel
5. Verify  → Test the live site
6. Share   → Post on HackLab
```

You now have a repeatable process for building and shipping web projects. Use it! 🚀
