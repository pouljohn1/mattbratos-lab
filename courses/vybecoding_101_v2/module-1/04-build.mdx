## plan

### what are we doing?

today we are building a startup landing page

I already built one because I needed to brainstorm what I even want on this website, and I created something like this

[https://v0-hhc-v1.vercel.app](https://v0-hhc-v1.vercel.app)

**Optional**

if you want, you can check out my process of building the original website with all the brainstorming. It took like 39 versions 😂 [my conversations with v0](https://v0.app/chat/minimalist-landing-page-rRMUg5TBpR6?ref=E7BMPP#fJOmPZ6zY4xUEjRKb6n1bUvnKqeVLJ1W)

### building

ok so before starting, it’s good to think about what we actually want to have on this landing page.
generally, landing pages have sections, here are the list of the most typical sections

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Header / Navigation** | Logo, menu, CTA button |
| **Hero Section** | Headline, value prop, main CTA, hero image |
| **Features / Benefits** | Key features and benefits |
| **Social Proof / Testimonials** | Reviews, testimonials, user stats |
| **Pricing** | Pricing tiers and options |
| **FAQ** | Common questions and answers |
| **Contact** | Contact form or links |
| **Call-to-Action (CTA)** | Final conversion message and button |
| **Footer** | Links, legal info, social icons |

### desiging

so obviously, we don’t need to add all of those into our first project. the beautiful thing about vibe coding is that it’s super flexible, so you can mix them however you like or even come up with an idea for your own section.

so let’s do this

I think that I want my website to have

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Nav Bar** | Logo, menu, CTA button |
| **Hero** | Headline, value prop, main CTA, hero image |
| **Manifesto** | Core beliefs and mission |
| **Journey** | social links |
| **Footer** | Links, legal info, social icons |

### prompt art

you could just go to v0 and tell it something like

```txt
build me a landing page for my startup homebrew hackers club
```

but it will give you a generic website with generic content and style.

actually much better idea is to give v0 more context and more info to do a better job. so let’s try with a prompt that looks like that

```txt
build me a landing page for my startup homebrew hackers club

structure
- nav bar
- hero
- manifesto
- journey
- footer 

```

this would actually work, and we would have this structure, but it would work even better if we describe what we want in each section

```txt
build me a landing page for my startup homebrew hackers club

structure
- nav bar
minimalistic logo "hhc" and 2 nav buttons for sections 

- hero
cool animated background and hero with a title 
* learn by hacking 
and description 
* Homebrew Hackers Club is an AI lab building Hacklab, a goto platform for learning AI tools.


- manifesto
write a placeholder manifesto for homebrew hackers club inspired by https://phrack.org/issues/7/3

- journey
cool animated background section with "follow the journey" title and 3 social media buttons below to instagram, x, and youtube. 

- footer 
a super minimalistic small footer only with "all rights reserved" and "for hackers, by hackers"

```

ok it looks much better, but still our style could be a little generic. you could just paste this in and talk with v0 to change it, but I think it’s better to define style in the first prompt and then just iterate on it.

- hero

style 
- Dark mode, ultraminimalistic aesthetics
- Mono font everywhere 
- cyberpunk vibe with neon colors
