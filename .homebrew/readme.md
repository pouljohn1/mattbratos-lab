# Homebrew Hackers Club — College Template

This repository is a minimal starter for creating a College on the Homebrew Hackers Club platform. Add courses and guides using MDX files, commit your changes, and your college updates on the platform once your repo is connected.

## What’s inside

- `home.mdx`: Your college landing page.
- `courses/`: Each folder is a course; files inside are chapters.
- `guides/`: Standalone guides.
- `assets/`: Images and other static assets.

Example structure:

```
assets/
  hackerlight.webp
courses/
  example-course/
    index.mdx        // course overview page
    chapter-1.mdx    // a chapter
    whatever.mdx     // another chapter
guides/
  example.mdx        // a standalone guide
home.mdx             // college homepage
```

## MDX + frontmatter

Content files are MDX with YAML frontmatter for metadata:

```mdx
---
title: Example Title
description: Short summary shown in listings
---

# Heading

Write in MDX. You can embed code blocks, images, and components.
```

## Create a course

1. Create a folder in `courses/` using your course slug, e.g. `courses/web-apis/`.
2. Add `index.mdx` with the course overview (include `title`, `description`, and optional `banner`).
3. Add chapter files like `chapter-1.mdx`, `chapter-2.mdx`, etc. Use clear filenames; they’ll map to chapter slugs on the platform.

## Create a guide

1. Add a new `.mdx` file in `guides/`, e.g. `guides/getting-started.mdx`.
2. Include frontmatter (`title`, `description`, optional `banner`) and your content.

## Use assets

Place images in `assets/` and reference them with relative paths:

```mdx
![alt text](../assets/hackerlight.webp)
```

## Update the college homepage

Edit `home.mdx` to customize your college’s landing page.

## Publish changes

Commit and push. Once your repository is connected to Homebrew Hackers Club, new commits will update your college automatically.
